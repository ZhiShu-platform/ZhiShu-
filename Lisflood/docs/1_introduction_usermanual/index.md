## About this user guide


This guide is hosted on GitHub Pages platform and it's the most up-to-date and complete user instruction of the LISFLOOD model. 
It contains a detailed step-by-step guide on what you need to do and know through the whole chain from the system requirements to receiving the LISFLOOD output. 

In order to apply this knowledge into practice, we provide two fully implemented test cases: [LISFLOOD User Cases](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-usecases/). By running the test cases, you can verify that the model has been installed and used by you correctly. Then it will be time for you to move onto your own set-up.

Note, this document is **not a LISFLOOD model documentation**. The [lisflood-model official documentation](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-model/) contains the most up-to-date and complete technical documentation of the LISFLOOD model. This includes all the concepts and model equations of all the standard LISFLOOD processes, but also all the optional modules. 

Lastly, we also share with you two other tools: 

* LISVAP, our tool to calculate the evapotranspiration and 
* our calibration tool that we've developed.
 
LISVAP Source code is on LISVAP [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-lisvap) while its documentation can be found at [LISVAP GitHub pages](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-lisvap/).

Calibration tool source code is on his dedicated [repository](https://github.com/ec-jrc/lisflood-calibration) while documentation is at [Calibration Tool GitHub Pages](https://ec-jrc.github.io/lisflood-calibration/).
